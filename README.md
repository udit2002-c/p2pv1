#Plate2Purpose - Every Plate Counts

Description:
Plate2Purpose is a smart food-saving tool designed to help caterers reduce waste, connect with organizations that feed the hungry, and gather feedback from customers. This project was submitted to the Google Solutions Challenge 2024. Plate2Purpose utilizes real-time data to display the amount of food wasted by caterers each day and offers suggestions for menu optimization. Additionally, it facilitates connections between caterers and organizations like the Robin Hood Army, which redistributes leftover food to those in need.
